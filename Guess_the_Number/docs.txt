GUESS_THE_NUMBER 
The code is written in java language.
It is a simple guessing game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100. 
It utilizes the java.util.Scanner class to take user input for guesses, allowing them to quit the game by entering a negative number. 
The program runs in a loop until the user correctly guesses the random number or chooses to quit. 
It provides feedback to the user, indicating whether their guess is higher or lower than the target number. 
Once the user guesses correctly or quits, the game terminates, making it an engaging and interactive console-based guessing game.
